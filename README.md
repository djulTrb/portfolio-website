## What Is This?

This is my **personal corner of the internet** — built from scratch, animated with intention, and designed to leave an impression. Every scroll, every transition, every line of code is deliberate. This isn't a template. This is a statement.

## Sections

| Section | What You'll Find |
|---|---|
| **Manifesto** | My philosophy as a developer — why I build and how I think |
| **Skills** | The tools I've mastered and keep sharpening |
| **Projects** | Real work. Real results. Live demos included |
| **Contact** | Let's build something together |

## Tech Stack

```js
const stack = {
  framework:   "React",
  styling:     ["Tailwind CSS", "SCSS"],
  animation:   ["Framer Motion", "GSAP"],
  bundler:     "Vite",
  deployment:  "Netlify",
};
```

### Why these tools?

- **React** — component-driven architecture keeps everything modular and scalable
- **Tailwind CSS + SCSS** — utility-first speed with the power of custom styling when needed
- **Framer Motion** — declarative animations that feel natural and responsive
- **GSAP** — for the heavy lifting: scroll-driven sequences, complex timelines, and silky-smooth effects
- **Vite** — blazing fast dev experience and optimized production builds
